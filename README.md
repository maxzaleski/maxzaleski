# Hello there! 👋

I'm a software engineer from London, UK. 

I would consider myself a backend engineer due to my strong interest in scalable distributed systems.
However, I am comfortable in a full-stack environment having worked on large Angular/React applications in the past.

I joined the field as a self-taught 19-year-old. I am now 24, and decided it was time to enroll for a BA in Software Engineering.

Most of the projects on my profile are from **2-3 years ago**.

In my spare time, I stay busy by working on a venture which I hope could be lucrative some day.
